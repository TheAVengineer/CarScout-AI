```
1. Telegram → New Channel
2. Name: "CarScout Deals"
3. Type: PUBLIC
4. Username: @CarScoutDeals (or any available name)

```

**B. Premium Channel (€14.99/mo)**
```

3. Type: PRIVATE (no username!)
4. Add @carscout_bg_bot as admin
5. Post: "Test from admin"
```

### Step 2: Get Channel IDs (2 minutes)

**Option A: Use Our Helper Script (EASIEST) ⭐**

After creating channels and posting test messages, run:

```powershell
python scripts/get_channel_ids.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Connect to your bot
- ✅ Find all channels where you posted messages
- ✅ Show you the channel IDs
- ✅ Generate the exact `.env` configuration

**Option B: Use Browser API (Manual)**

1. Post "Test from admin" in each channel
2. Open browser: 
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot8475247422:AAHVDBEI5TPkFhwUGpHFoi-Vun_YyfF4-gs/getUpdates
   ```
3. Find `"channel_post"` → `"chat"` → `"id"` (negative number)
4. Copy the IDs

---

### Step 3: Update .env File (1 minute)

Update these lines in `.env`:

```env
# Public Channel (your @username)
TELEGRAM_PUBLIC_CHANNEL=@CarScoutDeals

# Premium Channel (negative number from Step 2)
TELEGRAM_PREMIUM_CHANNEL=-1001938475629

# VIP Channel (negative number from Step 2)
TELEGRAM_VIP_CHANNEL=-1009876543210
```

---

### Step 4: Test Channel Posting (1 minute)

Run the test script:

```powershell
python scripts/test_channel_posting.py
```

This will verify your bot can post to all three channels.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Public Channel Tips
- Use an attractive name (e.g., "🚗 CarScout Deals Bulgaria")
- Write a good description for SEO
- Add channel link to your bot's welcome message
- Share it on Facebook groups, forums, etc.

### Private Channel Tips
- Premium = 10 best deals per day
- VIP = 20+ deals + 15 min early access
- Keep channel names simple and clear
- Add welcome message explaining benefits

### Bot Admin Permissions
The bot needs these permissions in ALL channels:
- ✅ Post Messages (required)
- ✅ Edit Messages (optional, but useful)
- ✅ Delete Messages (optional, for cleanup)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No updates found"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure bot is admin in channels
2. Post a test message in each channel
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Try again

### Problem: "Channel ID is positive number"

**Solution**:
- Positive IDs = group chats (wrong!)
- Negative IDs = channels (correct!)
- Make sure you created a CHANNEL, not a GROUP

### Problem: "Bot can't post to channel"

**Solution**:
1. Check bot is admin
2. Check "Post Messages" permission is enabled
3. Make sure you're using the correct channel ID
